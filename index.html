									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>This purpose of this project was to create a branding identity for an international travel company using only Adobe Illustrator.
										Through a website that randomized a series of city names, I got the city Kathmandu of Nepal, where I had to create three pieces of
										advertisments. The target audience chosen for this topic were Instagrammers that love to travel and "Gram" their adventures for
										their followers to see. All of the illustrations were done by following a design brief that was provided.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h2>The Three Pieces of Illustration</h2>
									<h3> 1) Postcard Illustration: </h3>
									<p align="justify">
										As the postcard would be the main advertisment piece for the destination, a lot of research was done about the city of Kathmandu.
										According to the design brief, the client wanted the postcard to be highliy illustrative, contain an adjective that is an
										aliteration of the city. As mentioned above, Kathmandu is a city that is rich with culture so to highlight that aspect of the city,
										the word "culture" was included in the postcard. However, to match with Kathmandu, it was decided to replace the letter "c" with "k".
										Another important aspect of this postcard was to include something that represented the city. The illustration on this postcard is of a
										famous temple, known as the Swayambhunath temple, is one of the oldest religious sites in Kathmandu. This temple attracts many tourists
										and so, to highlight Kathmandu's culture and heritage, the following temple was chosen to be illsutrated into the postcard.

									<h3> 3) Web Advertisement: </h3>
									<p align="justify">
										To promote the travel company, a web advertisement illustration was created highlighting the beauty of Kathmandu.
										According to the design brief, the ad is supposed to contain a slogan which would attact new clients to the travel company.
										This advertisment has a call to action that leads potential customers to know which company to contact or search for.
										The scenaries that are illustrated give the audience a view of what they could witness if they go for an adventure to Kathmandu.
										The city itself is rich with heritage and cultural values, so aspects like these are highlighted in the advertisement.
