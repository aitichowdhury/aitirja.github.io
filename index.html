									<h4 align="center">By Aitirja Chowdhury</h4>
								</header>

									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>This purpose of this project was to create a branding identity for an international travel company using only Adobe Illustrator.
										Through a website that randomized a series of city names, I got the city Kathmandu of Nepal, where I had to create three pieces of
										advertisments. The target audience chosen for this topic were Instagrammers that love to travel and "Gram" their adventures for
										their followers to see. All of the illustrations were done by following a design brief that was provided.
									</p>
									<br>
										<h2>Creating the Logo</h2>
										<span class="image fit"><img class="image center" src="images/GCM130_Logo01.png" alt="" width="400px" height="800px"></span>
										<p align="justify">
											The first priority of this project was to come up with a logo design that was simple and represented the core idea of the destination.
											The logo shown below represents the architecture of most buildings found in Kathmandu. As it is such a relevant architecture, it was important
											to include it as part of the design so that people could quickly recognize what it represents. A personal touch was added into this logo, as the clients
											had mentioned to include initials as part of the logo design.
										</p>
										<br>
									<h2>The Three Pieces of Illustration</h2>
									<h3> 1) Postcard Illustration: </h3>
									<p align="justify">
										As the postcard would be the main advertisment piece for the destination, a lot of research was done about the city of Kathmandu.
										According to the design brief, the client wanted the postcard to be highliy illustrative, contain an adjective that is an
										aliteration of the city. As mentioned above, Kathmandu is a city that is rich with culture so to highlight that aspect of the city,
										the word "culture" was included in the postcard. However, to match with Kathmandu, it was decided to replace the letter "c" with "k".
										Another important aspect of this postcard was to include something that represented the city. The illustration on this postcard is of a
										famous temple, known as the Swayambhunath temple, is one of the oldest religious sites in Kathmandu. This temple attracts many tourists
										and so, to highlight Kathmandu's culture and heritage, the following temple was chosen to be illsutrated into the postcard.
									</p>
									<br>
										<img src="images/GCM130_Postcard01.png" alt="" width="800px" height="600px">
									</br>
									<h3> 2) Snapchat GeoFilter: </h3>
									<p align="justify">
										The next focus for advertising the destination was to create a snapchat filter which the user would use to show highlights of their adventures to
										their friends. It is seen how geofilters are very popular amongst the target audience as most of them consist of young adults. The purpose of this filter
										was for the target audience to be able to showcase their stories, hence the design for this piece was kept to a minimum. Although, important features
										were inlcuded such as the string of christmas lights which are always lined up across the downtown of Kathmandu shocasing how bright the city gets as dusk falls.
										At the same time, the national flower of the country was included as it held a cultural value amongst the people of Kathmandu.
										<span class="image center"><img src="images/GCM130_Snapchat01.png" alt="" height="1500px"></span>
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3> 3) Web Advertisement: </h3>
									<p align="justify">
										Last but not least, a web advertisement illustration was created, highlighting another beauty of Kathmandu.
										According to the design brief, the ad is supposed to contain a slogan which would attact new clients to the travel company.
										This advertisment has a call to action that leads potential customers to know which company to contact or search for.
										The scenaries that are illustrated give the audience a view of what they could witness if they go for an adventure to Kathmandu.
										The city itself is rich with heritage and cultural values, so aspects like these are highlighted in the advertisement.

									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>Through a text randomizer, various adjectives were collected, of which the word "Thicc" was randomly assigned. This purpose of this project was to
										create a comic book cover using the assigned word only with Adobe Illustrator. Every other information was collected through research on target audience.
										The search included the theme or genre that the comic would be based on and also what colour scheme would be vest fitting to work with that theme. As it
										can be seen below, the theme was cute but the genre was mystery.

								<h4 align="center">By Aitirja Chowdhury</h4>
							</header>
							<h2>Who is your target audience/demographic?</h2>
							<p align="justify">I am targeting 25-34 years old people that have an average income range between
								$50,000-100,000 since they are the popular age group that buy more fine jewelry than any other age group.
							</p>
							<br>
								<img src="images/CRI300_Odette'sJewels.jpg" alt="" width="800px" height="1500px">
							</br>
							<br>
							<h2>What do they need/expect?</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								They expect to buy fine jewelry but in a price that is lower. Hence, I have included a sign for
								them to know that any purchase from the store is 50% off. I often see that stores that have an opening,
								always have sales like this and every time they have a lot of customers that come into the store to buy
								the product. As their income is usually low for this age group, they want jewelry prices to be reasonable price.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h2>How do they need/expect?</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								I am creating a theme that they could resonate with and obviously a storyline that they are aware of.
								Just like jewelry, if the advertisement holds an aesthetic where the design is simple; they are quickly
								able to get the information they need and know where to go to get their product.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h2>Inspirations, tools, and the process</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>I was inspired by the collections of pictures I got from Creative Commons which gave me the idea of creating
									an advertisement poster based on the story of the Swan Lake. Thus, I wanted to create an advertisement poster
									for a jewelry store with the theme from the story.</li>
								<li>First, pictures were collected to get inspiration for the kind of content I wanted to create.</li>
								<li>Once the pictures were collected, I focused on getting information for the kind of demographic that is usually
									interested in jewelry advertisements.</li>
								<li>Then, I researched on marketing strategies that I could use to incorporate onto my poster for my selected demographic.</li>
								<li>After collecting all the valuable information, I visited some of the tutorials that were posted in the previous discussion
									segment to get an idea on how to start the editing process.</li>
								<li>I searched online for guidance towards the art style I would like to portray and the elements of design I want to incorporate.</li>
								<li>Some elements of design that I used:
									<br><ul>
										<b>• Forms – Perspective: </b>to create the depth, a large diamond was included in the background that shown to be fading away.
										<br><b>• Texture:</b> using a colorful background but the texture of the background shows hints of watercolor.
										<br><b>• Shapes – Organic/natural: </b> the diamond in the back is creating an organic geometric shapes, versus the perfectly
										round white floor under the ballerina, gives an appropriate contrast, putting the focus on the ballerina.
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Some Principles of Design were followed:
									<br><ul>
										<b>• Space</b>
										<br><b>• Hierarchy: </b>the diamond is the main focus as it is bigger compared to the ballerina.
										<br><b>• Balance: </b>putting the texts containing information about the store in both sides
										<br><b>• Dominance: </b> which is the ballerina, the logo
									</ul>
								</li>

								<h2>Who is your target audience/demographic?</h2>
								<p align="justify">I am targeting an audience in the ages between 18-24 years old,
									especially women who would be interested in buying perfume. This age group is referred to as
									Gen Z and they are young adults who are usually finishing high-school and are about to step
									into the real world.
								</p>
								<br>
									<img src="images/CRI300_MagicShop.jpg" alt="" width="800px" height="1225px">
								</br>
								<br>
								<h2>What do they need/expect?</h2>
								<p align="justify">
									This age group needs something that they can easily find online as they spend majority of their time on the internet.
									They are also constantly on social media as this is their source of information for the things that are happening around the world. Their attention span is relatively lower than of the millennials and so any information they need to know must be clear and concise for them to see. Also, women in this demographic are the highest consumers of perfume, so they would definitely be interested in these products. At the same time, they want something that is authentic and natural, hence information about using natural products when making perfume is essential to include in the poster, which would get them interested in the products that my store has to offer.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>How do they need/expect?</h2>
								<p align="justify">
									As people in the ages between 18-24 years old tend to use social media and the internet a lot, they would definitely expect any store to have a website. Hence, emphasis is put on the fact that there is an online store and the website address is also given on the advertisement poster. Also, for easier access to the website an example QR code is incorporated onto the design so they can easily open the website on their phones. At the same time, this demographic also has an attention span on average of 8 seconds, hence information about my perfume store is kept minimal but important points are made on the poster so they get an appropriate amount of information. For example as mentioned before, this demographic love products that are authentic and natural. So not only am I mentioning the authenticity of the perfumes but also how they come at a reasonable price since this age group are newly graduated high-school students who wouldn’t have a stable job already.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Inspirations, tools, and the process</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>I am using an analogous color scheme mostly in the shades of purple and magenta as these are some of the colors that the Gen Z population are attracted to. When designing the bottle, I wanted to use light colors to contrast with the gradient background. Light colors are also signature colors used by this demographic, so including this to my design would catch their attention.</li>
									<li>Following design trends of 2020, I decided to use some of those trends onto my illustration. For example, I wanted to create simple illustrations, so that the poster is easy to read and understand. Also, another popular trend I used was 3D depth and realism to make the illustrations have a more realistic flow, rather than just a drawn picture on paper.</li>
									<li>I wanted my store name to be different from the information panel, hence I used a different font to go with the theme. However, in terms of information, I used a very simple font so its readable and accessible.</li>
								</ul>
